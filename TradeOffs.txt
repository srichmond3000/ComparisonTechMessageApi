Hard-coded data - in a production app this would be using a database with an ORM such as Entity Framework Core.

Logging - a production app would have logging, e.g. using Kibana.

Mapping - I would consider using AutoMapper instead of manually mapping.

Exception handling - in production there would be proper exception handling.

Parameter checking - public methods should check for null or out of range parameter values.
